# Qubit Feedback Stabilisation and Quantum_Trajectories
Qubit Feedback Stabilisation and Quantum_Trajectories Computational project on feedback-stabilization of an arbitrary pure state of a two-level atom - Jin Wang and H. M. Wiseman Phys. Rev. A 64, 063810 (2001). This projects explores the results of this paper through computation and the Jupyter Notebook titled 'Feedback_Stabilization.ipynb' displays details. 

The paper deals with how under certain conditions (using feedback-stabilisation) we can drive the qubit and stableise it in a pure state (ie: on the bloch sphere). It also deals with nonunit detector efficency.

I leave you with a simulation of the stochastic evolution of the Bloch equations for different detector efficiencies as described in the paper.
